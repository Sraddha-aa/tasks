                <p>Preserving and managing natural habitats is essential for wildlife 
                   conservation. This includes protecting forests, wetlands, grasslands, 
                   and other ecosystems that provide shelter, food, and breeding grounds for wildlife.
                   Species Preservation: Conservation efforts focus on safeguarding endangered and 
                   threatened species. This involves measures such as captive breeding, habitat restoration, anti-poaching efforts, and wildlife law enforcement.
                   Sustainable Resource Use: Balancing human needs with conservation
                   goals is important. Promoting sustainable practices for resource
                   extraction, fishing, hunting, and tourism can help minimize the 
                   negative impact on wildlife and ecosystems.</p>

                <p> Wildlife conservation refers to the protection, preservation, and management of wild animals, plants, and 
                    their habitats. It aims to ensure the long-term survival and well-being of various species and ecosystems.
                    Wildlife conservation is crucial for maintaining biodiversity, promoting ecological balance, and 
                    preserving natural resources for future generations.</p>
